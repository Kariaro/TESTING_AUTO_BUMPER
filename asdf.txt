testing another changelong maybe?

This file has now changed and I want to try the auto action now :D

Test 2:
Fixed action to use JDK-14. Trying pull request again.

Test 3:
Npx path should not be in the correct directory hopefully.

Test 4:
Updating branch and making sure that commit message header is printed correctly.
